JavaScript Datatypes
One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the 
set of data types it supports. These are the type of values that can be represented 
and manipulated in a programming language.
JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types −

Numbers, eg. 123, 120.50 etc.
Strings of text e.g. "This text string" etc.
Boolean e.g. true or false.


Naming variables
Variable names are pretty flexible as long as you follow a few rules:
Start them with a letter, underscore _, or dollar sign $.   name123
After the first letter, you can use numbers, as well as letters, underscores, or dollar signs.
Don’t use any of JavaScript’s reserved keywords.
Variable names are case-sensitive,  a   A

var name start with only => alpha : $ : _

var camelCase = "lowercase word, then uppercase";
var dinner2Go = "pizza";
var I_AM_HUNGRY = true;
var _Hello_ = "what a nice greeting"
var $_$ = "money eyes";


var 123abc  false
var ab c    No space



 VAR : KEYWORDS Use the var keyword only for declaration or initialization, 
 once for the life of any variable name in a document. 


<script type = "text/javascript">
	  var numb =10;
      var name = "Ali";
      var money;
      money = 2000.50;
</script>


You can also declare multiple variables

 var money, name;


      var money;
      money = 2000.50;
